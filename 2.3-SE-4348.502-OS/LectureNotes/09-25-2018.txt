	Big Picture
		Virtualization
			CPU
				Context Switch - includes current process, register values
				Schedules - can have multi level with priority
					FIFO
					LIFO
					
			Memory
				Allocation - setting limits for program
				Segmentation - 
				Paging - contain commonly accessed values, loaded in memory
					TLB
					Multilevel
					Swapping - pull from disk
					
	Big Picture
		Virtualization 	- only used when resource has to be shared
						- creates isolation between entities sharing
						- hides the fact of sharing from entities
			CPU			- sharing starts with CPU
						- we created an abstraction of process for the CPU
				Context Switch
						- 
						- policy determines who goes next
				Schedules
						- determines which process gets the time slice
			
			Memory 		- created abstract space called virutal memory
				Allocation
						- mapping of virtual memory to real memory
				Segmentation
						- deal withs internal fragmentation
						- doesn't deal with external fragmentation
				Paging
						- solves external fragmentation
						- each page is a equal size
						- created a new thing to store, the page table
					TLB
						- cache for some of the page table entries
					Multilevel
						- pageing of the page table so the size of the cache is reduced
					Swapping
						- demand paging
						- allows memory to move pages out for the demanded pages
						
	Threads
		Concurency - processes that are running simultaneously and independently
