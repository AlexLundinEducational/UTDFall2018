Review
	Segmentation		one process uses RAM at a time
	Time Sharing		add per process starting location to obtain physical address
	Base				several base+bound pairs per process	
	Base+Bounds			dynamic approach that verifies address is in valide range
	
	
	Segmentation
	
	MMU - Memory Management Unit
		- stores the segments
		
	Segmentation
		Problems
			Space utilization
				too big, wastes spaces
			Fragmentation
				free memory holes are too small and scattered
				
		Solution
			Paging
				divide physical memory into frames
				
	How to translate Virtual Address (VA) to Page Address (PA)
		Page Address
			20 bits | 12 bits
			page #  | page offset
			
		Virtual Address
			lowbits = offset
			high bits = total VA bits - low bits
		
		3 variables
			total bits
			number of bits for page #
			number of bits for offset size
