	Summary
		Translate problem into pure english
			then is it clear how to use sem_wait and sem_post
		Mutex
			mutual exclusion
			
	Semaphores
		initialize state with value
		from there one out, the state is hidden
		
		Operations
			sem_wait
				decrement counter
			sem_post
				increment counter
				
	Atomicity/ Mutual Exclusion Violation
		- variables are only modified when code is aware
		Caused by:
			data editing when program is not aware
		Fix:
			locks
	Order
		-thread 1 does some action that must be done before thread 2
		Caused by:
			action sequences between threads
		Fix:
			sem_wait on thread 2
			sem_post on thread 1
			
	Deadlock
		-every thread is waiting on other threads
		Caused by:
			1 mutual exclusion required
			2 holding and waiting
			3 no preemption (can't take resource from thread)
			4 circular wait (chain of threads hold and waiting)
		Fix:	
			break any 1 of the above conditions
