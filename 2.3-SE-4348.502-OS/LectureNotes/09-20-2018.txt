			A process requests phyiscal memory for a page and the memory is full.
			How to handle this request?
				My first idea:
				1.) Block the process
				2.) Search for necessary memory
				3.) Unblock when memory was found
				
				Answer:
				On demand paging
				
		Demand Paging
			Load page into memory on demand
			If the needed page is not there
				Detect and load page from disk
			Need hardware support
			
			Mechasism
				Invalid bit	
					already exists
					determines if memory is allocated or NOT
					
				How to find out if page is
					In memory or On Disk
					
					So add extra bit
					PTE - present bit set
					
				Aspects
					Extreme Case
						start process with no pages
						pure page demanding
					Instruction
				
			Policy
				Frame replacement
					takes a long time to, move page from memory to disk
					solution can have time to execute
				Algorithims
					goal is to reduce total number of faults
					several choices:
						optimal replacement
							replace page that will not be used for a long time
