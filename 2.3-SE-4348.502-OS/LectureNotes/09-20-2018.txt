Lecture
	Beyond Physical Memory
	
		In Class Discussion
			A process requests phyiscal memory for a page and the memory is full.
			How to handle this request?
				My first idea:
				1.) Block the process
				2.) Search for necessary memory
				3.) Unblock when memory was found
				
				Answer:
				On demand paging
				
		Demand Paging
			Load page into memory on demand
			If the needed page is not there
				Detect and load page from disk
			Need hardware support
			
			How to find out if page is
				In memory or On Disk
