02-Virtualization CPU 
	continued from problem 1 of direct execution
	
	Direct Execution
		Problem 2
		Problem 3
			Pros
				Restricts processes
	How to share the CPU
	Policy and Design must be separated
	
	Context Switching
		Pointers
		Registers
		Stack Pointer
		Processor Status Registers(PSR)
		
		Process Control Block (PCB)
			proc struct
			
			Contents:
			PID
			
	Process State Transition
	Process List
		each processes ID by PID
		Ready queue - contains all ready processes
		Event queue - one logical queue per event
			disk I/O and locks
			contains all PIDs waiting for event
03-Scheduling
	Mechanism - dispatcher
		how to switch between processes
		
	Policy - scheduler
		which process to switch to
		
	Workload assupmtions
		These are key to understanding the problem
		**understand the question before solving the problem
		**understand the optomization metrics (how will the solution be evaluated?)
		
	Turnaround time
		time waiting to get CPU is included in addition to the time to complete
		
	FIFO
		First in First Out
		Pros
			Fair, unbiased
		Cons
			Convoy Effect
	SJF
		Shortest Job First
		Small runtime gets priority
		Pros
			Reduces turnaround time
			Gain alot by moving the shortest to the front
		Cons
			Bias
			Not much is gained, by moving the longest to the end
			
	STCF
		Shortest Time to completion first
		Pros
			Allows jobs to arrive at random time
		Cons
			Bias
			Context switch overhead
