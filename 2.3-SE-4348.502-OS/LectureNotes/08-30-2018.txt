03-Scheduling (slide 19)
	Not I/O aware
	
	New Metric, response time
		interactive jobs
			FCFS, SJF and STCF are not good
			
	Round Robin Scheduler
		fixed-length time slice
		time-quantum
		
		Length of time slice is critical
			Shorter
				better response time
				too many context switches
			Longer
				fewer context switches
				poorer response time
		Pros
			response time is speedy
		Cons
			turnaround time takes a dump
				
	RR vs SJF
