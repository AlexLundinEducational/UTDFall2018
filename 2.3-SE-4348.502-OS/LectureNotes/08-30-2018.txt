03-Scheduling (slide 19)
	Not I/O aware
	
	New Metric, response time
		interactive jobs
			FCFS, SJF and STCF are not good
			
	Round Robin Scheduler
		fixed-length time slice
		time-quantum
		
		Length of time slice is critical
			Shorter
				better response time
				too many context switches
			Longer
				fewer context switches
				poorer response time
		Pros
			response time is speedy
			does not care about duration of job
				job that runs to infinity is ok
		Cons
			turnaround time takes a dump
				
	Summary
		Turnaround
			SJF
		Reponse
			RR
	
	General Purpose Scheduling
		must support two types of jobs
			interactive jobs
			batch jobs
			
		So 
		1 run interactive first
		2 then run shorter jobs before longer
		
		Multi leve feedback queue (MLFQ)
			top level has highest prio
			every level is it's own queue
			
			rule 1: if A > B then A wins
			rule 2: if A = B then A & B run in RR
