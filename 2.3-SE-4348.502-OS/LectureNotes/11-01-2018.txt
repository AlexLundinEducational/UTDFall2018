	Summary
	
	Contiguous Allocation
		Pros
			Head won't have to move much
			Calculating block location is easy, only have to know block start and the offest
			
		Cons
			External fragmentation
				Solution
				Indexed Table
			May not be able to grow files
			
	Indexed Tables
		Each file gets a index table
		Part of the inode for the file
		
		Cons
			Size
			
		Example
			max file 1MB, block size 512 bytes
			(2 ^ 20) / (2 ^ 9) = 2 ^ 11
			
			(2 ^ 11) / (2 ^ 2) = (2 ^ 9) = 8KB table size
			
			max file 4GB
			(2 ^ 32) / (2 ^ 12) = (2 ^ 20)
			(2 ^ 20) / (2 ^ 2) = (2 ^ 18)?
			
		Solution
			Dynamic Allocation with static allocation for small files
	
	Dynamic Allocation
		each file gets a certain block of space
		if file grows past it gets 1 indirect
		if file grows past it gets 2 indirect
