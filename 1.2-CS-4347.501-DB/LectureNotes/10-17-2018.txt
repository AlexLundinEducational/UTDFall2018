	Triggers
		dynamic actions that take place on tables
		
	In class example
		DB A
			Data for objects
			
		Application B
			Flat table of objects created from Tables in A
		
		Data replication
			this is a nightmare
			
	Test this assertion:
	CREATE ASSERTION SALARY_CONSTRAINT
	CHECK ( NOT EXISTS ( SELECT *
		FROM	EMPLOYEE E, EMPLOYEE M
				DEPARTMENT D
		WHERE	E.Salary>M.Salary
				AND E.Dno=D.Dnumber
				AND D.Mgr_ssn=M.Ssn ));
				
	Views
		virtual tables that protects us from having to write the same query over and over
		can give other users access to the view
		these are a representation of the database
		inherits all contraits from the database
		solves the problem of giving access to certain data from the database
		allows other applications to access data from the database without understanding the schema
	v1

	CREATE VIEW WORKS_ON1
	AS SELECT Fname, Lname, Pname, Hours
	FROM	EMPLOYEE,PROJECT,WORKS_ON
	WHERE Ssn=Essn AND Pno=Pnumber;

	SELECT * WORKS_ON1
		WHERE 1=1;
		
	DROP VIEW WORKS_ON1	
		
	v2
	
	CREATE VIEW DEPT_INFO (Dept_name, No_of_emps, Total_sal)
	AS SELECT Dname, COUNT(*), SUM(Salary)
	FROM	DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE
	WHERE Dnumber=Dno
	GROUP BY Dname;
	
	SELECT * WORKS_ON1
		WHERE 1=1;	
		
	DROP VIEW DEPT_INFO 
	
Ch14-Basics of FD and Normalization
	Slide 1 - 
	
	**Relational Database Schema (slide 9)
		Boxes pointing between tables
		Shows logical relation
		Lists out names of columns
		Lists out name of foreign keys and primary keys
	Guidline 1
		schema easily understood from relation to relation
	Guidline 2
		Insertion Update and Removal
	Guidline 3
		attributes with frequent null values could be placed in separate relations
			with the primary key
		reasons
			attribute N/A
			attribute unknown
			attribute known but unavaible
			
	Functional Dependencies
		look at the mapping from 1 column to another column
		anything that is 1 to 1 uniqueness is a dependency
		1 to n is not a dependency, because column a doesn't gaurentee the same value in column be
		
	Functional Constraints
	
	Normalization
		process of breaking table into smaller relations
		tieing small pieces together with primary key and foreign key
		
	Normal form
		uses keys and Functional Dependencies of a relation to certify
			if a relation schema is in a PARTICULAR normal form
	First Normal Form
	Second Normal Form
