	Factors that contribute to Project Failure
		Getting requirements right, leads to higher probability of success
		many statistics show that we are good programmers, but our faults in requirements analysis
			cause the majority of problems that slow projects
		the standish group found that INCOMPLETE REQUIREMENTS are the biggest factor
		
Main concepts from this Lecture
	We covered test format
		Mostly material from the lectures
		Secondary information can be found on the webpage, these links here below \/ \/
			Priorities: Class Discussions !!, Lecture Notes !, Primary Reading and References!!!
		15 minute review before the test, in class
		
		
		Test questions
			Short explanation
			Drawing questions

	Introduction module 
	(Why, What and How) Slide 8 to the end
		Why do RE?
			Success rate is dependent on project size
				bigger projects are more likely to fail
				bigger project have more communication channels, increasing errors
				
			How costly are RE errors?
				100X more costly than programming (implementation and design) errors
			
			Formal Inspection
				takes place in top notch organizations on a weekly basis
				more effective than testing
					can be done on ANY kind of document 
					testing is only related to programs
			
		What is RE?
			Requirements Engineering is a Branch of Systems Engineering
			
			System Engineering -> System Doc -> 3 Kinds of Wares
				1 Goals ( )
				2 Services (UML use case with actor)
				3 Constraints ( )
				
			Verification
				proves absense of errors
				proofs with 1st order logic
				
			Validation
			
			Testing 
				proves precense of errors
