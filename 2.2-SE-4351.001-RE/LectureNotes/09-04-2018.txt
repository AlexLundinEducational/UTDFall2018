Slide Deck
	Introduction module 
		(Why, What and How) Slide 8 to the end
		Success rate is dependent on project size
			bigger projects are more likely to fail
			bigger project have more communication channels, increasing errors
			
		How costly are RE errors?
			100X more costly than programming (implementation and design) errors
		
		Formal Inspection
			takes place in top notch organizations on a weekly basis
			more effective than testing
				can be done on ANY kind of document
