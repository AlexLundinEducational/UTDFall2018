Review
	3 kinds of wares
		Hardware
		Software
		Peopleware
		
	People are everything
	
Main concepts from this Lecture
	we have to include atleast 1 slide, illustrating "as-is" scenario
		list the problems
		the problems turn into requirements specification
		incomplete "as-is" results in crappy requirements
		
	think about this project from blind persons perspective
		have 1 person role play, as them, continuosly
		
Project
	Why are we building this app?
		To help people
		
		Starting point for everyone project
		Translate requirements from As-is -> To-be
		
		1) Clearly ID what the problems are:
			What are the problems this system will solve?
			"As-is"
			
		2) Clearly ID what the solutions are:
			What are the solutions?
			"To-be"
	
	In class example of instructor and his parents
		hearing loss	
			mom doesn't like wearing hearing aid
			feels weird
			we percieve her as no capable
			she is concerned with how she is percieved
		memory loss
			his dad has memory loss
			
		solutions
