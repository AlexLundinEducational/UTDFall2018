Project
	Phase I
		I.1 Interim (Present)
			Start mockup
		I.2 Final
			Mockup is ok, to represent the product without code
			Write some codes, but no need to write all codes
				Atleast icon must appear
				Maybe a few screens must work
				Bonus points for more functionality
					Use acceleromitor
					Object and distance detection
