	Phase I
		The focus is on product
		No formal notation or semiformal notation, required
		All of this is information specification such as mockup, and verbal description
		
		Deliverables:
		Process Specification
			Describe how the work will be done
			Task breakdown
		Powerpoint
		
		I.1 Interim (Present)
			Start mockup
		I.2 Final
			Mockup is ok, to represent the product without code
			Write some codes, but no need to write all codes
				Atleast icon must appear
				Maybe a few screens must work
				Bonus points for more functionality
					Use acceleromitor
					Object and distance detection
					
	Phase II
		The focus is on process AND product
		Semi formal documentation IS required like UML
		Some functional code
		II.1 Interim
		II.2 Final (Present)
