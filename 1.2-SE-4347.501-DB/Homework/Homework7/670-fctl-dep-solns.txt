CIS 670, Spring 2002, TR 9:30
Homework 6: Functional Dependencies Readings and Practice Problems


14.17 Functional Dependencies

    Student:
    SNUM -> SNAME, SSN, SCADDR, SCPHONE, SPADDR, SPPHONE, BDATE, SEX,
            CLASS, MAJORCODE, MINORCODE, PROG
    SSN -> SNUM
                   (Assumes only one major and minor per student.)

    Department:
    DCODE -> DNAME, DOFFICE, DPHONE, DCOLLEGE
    DNAME -> DCODE

    Course:
    CNUM -> CNAME, CDESC, CREDIT, LEVEL, CDEPT
            (Assumes course numbers such as "CIS 670" or "123-670".)

    Section:
    SECCOURSE, SECNUM, SEMESTER, YEAR -> INAME

    Grade:
    SSN, SECCOURSE, SECNUM, SEMESTER, YEAR -> GRADE

         Choose primary key as first attribute on left, 
         i.e. SNUM; DCODE; CNUM;
              SECCOURSE, SECNUM, SEMESTER, YEAR;
              SSN, SECCOURSE, SECNUM, SEMESTER, YEAR


14.22 Update anomalies
    EMP_PROJ

        Can't INSERT a new employee without a project or a new project
        without an employee.

        DELETE employee "Smith, John B."  Must delete both tuples.  If he
        had been the last employee on project 1 or 2, would also have to
        delete that project, losing PNAME, etc..

        DELETE project 1.  Must delete both tuples.  If an associated
        employee was not working on another peoject, ENAME, etc. for that
        employee would be lost.

        MODIFY employee "Smith, John B." name  Must modify both tuples.
        MODIFY project 1's  name or location.  Must modify both tuples.


    EMP_DEPT
        Can't INSERT new employee without a department.

        DELETE department 5.  Must delete 4 tuples.

        MODIFY name of department 5.  Must modify 4 tuples.


14.25 Why do spurious tuples occur in the result of joining EMP_PROJ1
and EMP_LOCS relations of Fig. 14.5?

    The first three spurious tuples come from English and Wong, because
    both are in Sugarland and English is also in Bellaire.  Others are
    similar.

14.28 a. Can the following functional dependencies hold?  If not, why not?
        i. A -> B   NO  A   B
                        10  b1  #1
                        10  b2  #2

        ii. B -> C  OK  

        iii. C -> B NO  B   C
                        b1  c1  #1
                        b4  c1  #4
                        b1  c1  #5

        iv. B -> A  NO  A   B
                        10  b1  #1
                        13  b1  #5
                        12  b3  #4
                        14  b3  #6

        v. C -> A   NO  A   C
                        10  c1  #1
                        11  c1  #3
                        13  c1  #5
                        12  c4  #4
                        14  c4  #6

     b. Potential Candidate Key
                  Note also that A -|-> C.

                  Since B -> C may hold, but all other single FDs do
                  not hold, A,B is the only possible candidate key.


14.29 R(A, B, C, D, E) with FDs
                            AB -> C
                            CD -> E
                            DE -> B

    Is AB a candidate key?
       No.  AB -|-> D

    Is ABD a candidate key?
       Yes.
	   All attributres depend on ABD.
	       AB -> C  => ABD -> C
	       D  -> D  => ABD -> D
		  Above => ABD -> CD
	       Above and CD -> E => ABD -> E

	   Can't take subset of ABD.
	       AB no good by above.
	       AD -|-> anything
	       BD -|-> anything
