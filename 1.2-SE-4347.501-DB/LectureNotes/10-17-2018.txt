Lecture Summary:
	Create trigger in the project where it MAKES SENSE
	
Ch7-Complex Queries

	
	Slides 30 - End
	
	Select with group by
	Ignore recurise query slides (38-39)
	
	Triggers
		dynamic actions that take place on tables
		
	In class example
		DB A
			Data for objects
			
		Application B
			Flat table of objects created from Tables in A
		
		Data replication
			this is a nightmare
			
	Test this assertion:
	CREATE ASSERTION SALARY_CONSTRAINT
	CHECK ( NOT EXISTS ( SELECT *
		FROM	EMPLOYEE E, EMPLOYEE M
				DEPARTMENT D
		WHERE	E.Salary>M.Salary
				AND E.Dno=D.Dnumber
				AND D.Mgr_ssn=M.Ssn ));
				
	Views
		virtual tables that protects us from having to write the same query over and over
		can give other users access to the view
		these are a representation of the database
		inherits all contraits from the database
		solves the problem of giving access to certain data from the database
		allows other applications to access data from the database without understanding the schema
	v1

	CREATE VIEW WORKS_ON1
	AS SELECT Fname, Lname, Pname, Hours
	FROM	EMPLOYEE,PROJECT,WORKS_ON
	WHERE Ssn=Essn AND Pno=Pnumber;

	SELECT * WORKS_ON1
		WHERE 1=1;
		
	DROP VIEW WORKS_ON1	
		
	v2
	
	CREATE VIEW DEPT_INFO (Dept_name, No_of_emps, Total_sal)
	AS SELECT Dname, COUNT(*), SUM(Salary)
	FROM	DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE
	WHERE Dnumber=Dno
	GROUP BY Dname;
	
	SELECT * WORKS_ON1
		WHERE 1=1;	
		
	DROP VIEW DEPT_INFO
