Ch14-Basics of FD and Normalization
	Slide 27 - 
	
	Normalization- decomposing unsatisfactor relations by
			breaking up their attributes into smaller realtions
			
	First Normal Form
		Disallows
			composite attributes
			multivalue attriubtes
			nested realtions
			
	Second Normal Form
		Uses of the concept of Functional Dependencies
		
		Anything output from a FD must be unique
		Dropping anything from a FD will break it
	
	Third Normal Form
		only attributes that DEPEND on the primary key can stay
		any transistive attributes have to get out and go to another table
