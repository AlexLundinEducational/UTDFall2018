Chapter 1
	Definitions:
	Database - collection of related data
	Miniworld - some aspect of the real world, modeled by the database
	
	data record - entry in a database
	data element - individual pieces of each record
	data type	- kind of information stored in a element
	meta data	- describes the structure of a database
	self describing data - data item and data names stored together, in one structure
	operation
		1 interface / signature
		2 implementation
		
	data abstraction 			- yields program and data independence
	conceptual representation	- details of how data is stored
	data model					- type of data abstraction that provides conceptual representation
	concurency control - ensures several users can access DB at same time
	transaction			- executing program or process that includes one or more database accesses
	isolation			- each transaction is independent
	atomicity			- all or none
	1.3
	Database vs file storeage
		self-describing nature of database system
		insulation between programs, data and data abstraction
		supports multiple views of data
		sharing of data and multiuser processing
		
	1.4 Actors and the Scene
	Definitions:
	DBA					- authorize users, chief admin responsible for managing resources
	DB designer			- id the data stored, use appropriate structures, develop views
	End Users			- jobs require access
		Casual			- middle to high level managers
		Naive			- revolves around queries
		Sophisticated	- engineers, framiliarize themselves with facilities of DBMS to implement their own apps
		Standalone		-	maintain personel DB, use ready made packages, menu bars
	System Analysts		- determine requirements of end users
	Application programmers	- implement specifications from analysts
	SE					- framiliar with full range of capablilties of DBMS to accomplish their tasks

	1.5 Workers behind the scene
	Definitions:
	DBMS system designers and implementers
						- design and implement modules
	Modules				- component
	Tool devs			- write tools to improve performance of DBMS
	Operators and maintenece personel
						- system admins
						
	1.6 Advantanges of DB approach
	1 Controlling Redundancy
		Controlled Redundancy	-storing same data multiple times to improve performance
		data normalization 		- storing each piece of information, only once
		data denormalization	- including new data, in addition to adjacent data which may be necessary to pair with the new
	2 Restricting unauthorized access
		security				- accounts
		previledge software		- provides extended features, of core software, to certain users
	3 Persistent Storage
	4 Storage structures, search techniques and Query Processing
		indexes					- auxiliary files to disk searches
		buffering				- maintains part of DB in main memory
		query processing		- responsible for choosing efficient queries
	5 Backup and Recovery
	6 Multiple User Interface
	7 Represent complex relationships
	8 Enforce Integrity Constraints
		Business rules
	9 Rules and Triggers
		Rule					- defines states or conditions that arise from data
		Triggers				- form of a rule, engaged when updating the table

	1.8 When NOT to use DBMS
	When any of these costs becomes to high
		high initial cost
		defining and processing data
		overhead for security, concurrency and recovery
	Conditions
		simple, well defined database applications are not expected to changes
		stringent, real time requirements
		embedded systems
		no multiple user access
