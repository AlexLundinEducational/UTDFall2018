3.8 Summary (85)
	Why is searching valueable?
		Because it gives a solution when the agent is not clear
		on which immediate action is best. The search returns
		a possible sequence of actions for the agent to 
		consider.
	
	Definitions:
		problem
			1 intial state 
			2 set of operators
			3 goal test function
			4 path cost function
			
		environment - represents the problem state space
		path - route through state space, from initial state to solution
		breadth first - expands shallowest node first
		uniform cost - expands least cost node first
		depth first - expands deepest node first
		depth limited - place limit on how deep a depth first search can go
		iterative deepening - depth-limited with increasing limt until goal is reached
		bidirectional - reduces time complexity, increases memory useage
		
	Evaluation:
		completeness
		optimality
		time complexity
		space complexity
