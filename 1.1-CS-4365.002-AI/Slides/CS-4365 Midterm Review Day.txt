	CH1
		Place the 5 phases of AI in chronological order
		
		Discussion about state of the art
		
		Chapter summary
	
	CH2
		agents
			the basic agent function
		good behavior
			rationality
		PEAS
		
		Describe internal structure of 4 agents at a high level
		
		Representing states
			atomic
			vector...
			
	CH3
		well defined problems
		toy problems
		path cost
		
		real world problems
		
		Search
			tree search
			infrastructure for search
				what data structures
				state
				parent
				action
				path cost
					
		Evaluation
			completeness
			op
				
	Uninformed Search
		Depth-First Search (DFS)  
			counterclockwise traversal around perimeter "around the tree"
		Depth-Limited Search (DLS) 
			counterclockwise traversal, one level at a time, around perimeter "around the tree"
		Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) 
		
		Bidirectional Search
		
	Informed Search  
		Be able to to work out given problems  
			Greedy Best-First Search  
			A* 
			Recursive Best-First Search (RBFS) 
		Questions about 
			Memory Bounded A* (MA*) 
			Simplified Memory Bounded A* (SMA*) 
		Heuristic Functions
			properties
				valid heuristics can never overestimate
				
		CH4
			local search	
				hill climb
				simulated annealing
				beam search
					hill climb with agents in parallel
					size of beam is number of agents
			genetic algorithims
				naive - 2 parents
				breeding population
			complicating the search
				searching without percepts
				searching with non-deterministic actions
				searching with percepts AND non-determinism
				
				in the vaccum cleaner world is it possible to search with non-determinism and gaurentee 
					completeness?
					optimality?
					
			CH5
				minimax
				alpha-beta pruning
				search vs lookup
					lookup for first 4 moves of chess
					then switch to search
				partially observable
					cards
				state of the art games
					questions only
					mostly deep learning
					
		Question 5
		{node}, f = cost{ToNode} + h{node}
		{s} f = 0 + 7
		{s,a} f = 1 + 6
		{s,b} f = 4 + 2
		
		
		Draw minimax search tree
		be able to alpha-beta prune a tree, simply circling the node
