	Problem Solving Agents
		Performance Measures
		
		Problem Solving agent
		1.) Figure out what the problem is
		2.) Figure out the best way to search that problem space
		
		Well defined problems have 5 parts:
		1.) initial state
		2.) set of actions
		3.) transistion model, describing those actions
		4.) goal test function
		5.) path cost function
		
		state space - environment of the test problem
		solution - path through state space, from problem to goal
		
	Searching
		Metrics for evaluation
			completness
			optimality
			time complexity
			space complexity
