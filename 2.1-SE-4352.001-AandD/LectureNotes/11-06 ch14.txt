chapter 14
modeling architecture to enable quality attribute analysis
performance modeling-talk in terms of queuing theaory
scheduling policy for queuing theaory
concept of fifo/ first in first out (oldest comesout first)
concept of lifo -> last in first out(newest comes out first/stack)
priority -> pre-emptive higher priority msg first out
shortest job first -> prevents starvetion
round robin policy -> equal turns to all catagories
shortest remaining time first -> 

availaility modeling
active redundancy-pro  always avilable, con cost to maintain realtime backup hot spare
passive redundancy-pro less cost to maintain, con not always avilable		warm spare
cold sparing-pro saves lot of money,con manually copy brocker spare takes time and money

independent event a and b probablitiy(a or b) =p(a) + p(b)
independent event a and b probablitiy(a and b)=p(a) * p(b)
dependent event a and b probablitiy(a and b)= p(a)*p(b|a)

thought experiment
back of the envelope analysis
-drawback analysis paralysis
-stuck in endless meeting for over analysis, 
	set deadline of length of discussion/time boxing

experiments, simulation, and prototypes
-invest time

fault injection tool- response of system under stress

enumarate responsibilities or action neede to be carried out for cancel operation in UI
system acknoleges
	reciept of cancel
	command
if yes system stops the operation
system return to prevous state before user lauched the operation


1) cancelation of low priority task happens in background
2) vs safety critical cancelation pre-emptive cancelation, takes up all the resources
takes priority
