Module 1
	Definitions:
		fundamental organization of a system, embodied in it's components,
			relationships and principles governing design and evolutions.
			
	Analogy Example: Importance of architecture to a non-technical person
	Common Elements (Slide 11)
		major components
		relationships and interactions
		omits low level functions
		includes rational behind the low level functons
		NOT a single structure

	SDLC-Waterfall
		RE -> analysis and design -> build and test -> integration -> deploy
		planning                  -> construction
		Pros
			linear progress
			favors small projects
		Cons
			does not handle change well
	Iterative
		incremental delivery
		Pros
			handles change well
		Cons
			
	Agile
		People oriented
		Pros
			handles change well
		Cons
			communication overhead
	Spiral
		ID, Design, Build, Evaluate / Risk analysis
		Pros
			handles change well
		Cons
			chaotic sprial
	Architecture Vs. Design (Slide 32)
		high vs low
Module 2
	What is Software Architecture (Slide 5 & 7)
	Views and Structures (Slide 14)
	
	Architectural Patterns
		-Generic Layered
		-Repository Architecture
		-Client-Server architecture
		-pipe and filter
		-hybrid architectures.
		
	What makes good architecture?
		-Good rule of thumb (Slide 26)
	
	Who is involved in Architecture
		Stakeholders
		
	Responsibilities and Skillsets of Architects (Slide 37)
	Goal of SA (Slide 39)
	3C's Advice for managers (Slide 41)
	AIC (Slide 44)
	
Module 3
	ASR (Slide 3-5)
	4 ways to gather ASR:
		-ASR from Stakeholders
		-Quality Attribute Workshop (Slide 10)
			-know the steps
		-ASRs from the Business Goals	
			-categories of business goals
		-Utility Tree
			-What is a Utility Tree (Slide 19)
			-Example (Slide 20 and 21)
			-Next steps (Slide 23)

	Inhibiting or Enabling System's Quality Attribute (Slide 4)
	Changes (Slide 5)
	Predicting System QA (Slide 6)
	Communication of Stakeholder
	Design Decision
	Constraints
	Organizational Structure
	Prototype

	Independent Systems
		-Commercial off the shelf
	Restriction of Design Vocab
	Basis for training
	Slide 19
		-Answer: depends on organization
	Slide 20
		Functionality and QA are Orthogonal (independent)
	Quality Attribute Considerations
	How do we make decisions (slide 32)
		Allocation of responsibilities
		Data and Coordination models
	Mapping

		-Main program and Subroutine
		Object oriented
		Layered
		Client Server
		Pipe and Filter
		Peer to Peer
		Publish-Subscribe
		Blackboard
