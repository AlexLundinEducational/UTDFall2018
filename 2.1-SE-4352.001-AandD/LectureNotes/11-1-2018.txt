Reverse Engineering

	Why Reverse Engineering?
		recovery of lost info
		reuse
		
	Design recovery
	
	Redocumentation
		simple
		unintrusive form of reconstruction
		
		
	Views
		structural
		functional
		behavioral
		
	Reengineering vs Reverse Engineering

	Reconstruction
		original developers gone
		recorded documents lost
		original developers did not follow plan
		form of reverse engineering
		
	Purposes:
		ensure conformance between as built and as designed
		
	Extracting Architecture
		human experts
		recognizing known patterns
		reconstructing file mappings (object file to a class file)
		
	Reconstruction Phases
		Raw view extractions
			source code, build scripts
			extract existing architecture
				code, header files, build files
				execution traces
			capture interests from extracted information
				variables, function names
			dynamic	information 
				might not be avaiable from source code
				poylmorphism, function pointers, runtime parameterization, plugins
			common tools
				static
					lexical analyziers, parsers, AST
				dynamic
					profiler, code instrumation tools
		Database construction
			raw views are too specific
			convert each view into a standard form
			allow manipulations
				hidding methods in class definition
		View fusion and manipulation
			combine views from database
			individual views might now be completted
				static view might miss dynamic calling functions
			static + dynamic = more holistic view
				might see new aspect of the architecture
			new aggregations of elements
		Architecture Analysis
			view fusion results in set of hypothesis about system
			finding violations
				Architect indicates relationships
				Sonar J automatically detects and reports violations
				
	Dynamic Analysis
	
	Guidlines
		have a goal
		have a representation of architecture
			even if it is very course, this will show what you want to extract
			draw it ourselves if we have to
		identify layers is a good place to start
		existing documentation may not be accuracte
		tools can support and shorten the process
			include anyone who may have knowledge of system

		What are barries to high quality?
			missunderstanding quality attributes
			inadquate langauges for expressing design requirements
			lack of documented designed
			quality control aspects
			
		Interoperability
		
		Security
		
		Performances
